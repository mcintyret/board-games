An API that can be used to model, view and play a wide range of board games that are played on a rectangular grid. Current implementations include chess, checkers and chutes and ladders. The design is hierarchical, and I have tried to use as much abstraction as possible to prevent code reuse in the concrete classes representing playable games, while avoiding any unnecessary constraints in the capabilities of the classes.
